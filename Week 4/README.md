Why effect size matters?



- It enables communicating the practical significance of effects, facilitating meta-analyses, and power analyses.
    - For example, a Facebook study showed that people who see less negatives posts will tend to post more positive content, and vice versa. However, the effect size is very tiny that it really doesn’t mean much.

- **Statistically significant ≠ practically significant**
- On the other hand, small effect can be meaningful too
    - For eg, a study show that 0.11 of effect size, despite seemingly small, can be meaningfully impactful

What are the two ways to describe the difference?

- **d** family: standardized mean differences
- **r** family: measures of strength of association



What is the formula of cohen’s d?

- Difference of mean / standard deviation
    - Eg, “fight club” is rated 8.9 on imdb, and 7.3 on rotten tomatoes, we know the standard deviation of all movies’ ratings is 1.4 —> the cohen’s d = 1.6/1.4 = 1.14 (Pretty big effect!) (Slight variation exists when comparing samples/polulation)
    - range from 0 to inf
    - Benchmark: 0.2 —> small effect, 0.5 —> medium, 0.8 —> big effect (Better to compare with similar studies!)



What is hedges’ g?


- When sample size is small, cohen’s d tend to overestimate, hedges’g is simply cohen’s d times a correction (The bigger the sample, less the correction)



How to calculate cohen’s d from t-value?

We know within-designs can be more powerful, but why?

Why we need to correct for bias?


- Population effect sizes are almost always estimated on the basis of samples, and as a measure of the population effect size estimate based on sample averages, Cohen’s d overestimates the true population effect (when Cohen’s d refers to the population, the Greek letter δ is often used). Therefore, corrections for bias are used (even though these corrections do not always lead to a completely unbiased effect size estimate).
